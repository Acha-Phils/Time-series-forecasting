# TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING DEEP LEARNING 
This study compares the performance of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX), 
Prophet, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in forecasting hourly power consumption in the Eastern Intercontinental grid of the United States (2002-2018). 
The focus was on predictive accuracy and training time, using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE).
